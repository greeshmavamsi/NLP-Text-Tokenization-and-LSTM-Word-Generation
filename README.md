# NLP-Text-Tokenization-and-LSTM-Word-Generation
This Python program utilizes NLP techniques to tokenize text using Transformers, NLTK with stopwords, and spaCy. It then trains an LSTM model for word generation. Implemented in PyTorch, the model optimizes using Adam and cross-entropy loss. A comprehensive example of text preprocessing and LSTM-based word generation.

## Dependencies

- transformers
- nltk
- spacy
- torch

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the script: `python your_script_name.py`
